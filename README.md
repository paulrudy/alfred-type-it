# Type It - Alfred workflow

## Note on updating to version 2+

The bundleID has changed since version 1.x. Importing later versions than 3.x will create a new Alfred workflow instead of updating the previous one.

Once you've imported the new version, delete the old version (check the version number beginning with `v` at the top of the main window). This also means that any changes you've made to the workflow's configuration will need to be redone.

Type the clipboard contents with options for typing speed. Useful for dialog boxes on some sites that disable pasting.

## Setup

Use "Configure Workflow..." to edit keyword if needed

## Usage

Invoke the keyword to have Alfred simulate typing the clipboard contents (maximum 500 characters) wherever the system's focus is currently active.

Default typing speed is fast. Hold ⌥ to have Alfred type at medium speed, or ⌥⇧ for slow speed.
