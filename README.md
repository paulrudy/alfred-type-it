# Type It - Alfred workflow

Type the clipboard contents with options for typing speed. Useful for dialog boxes on some sites that disable pasting.

## Setup

Use "Configure Workflow..." to edit keyword if needed

## Usage

Invoke the keyword to have Alfred simulate typing the clipboard contents (maximum 500 characters) wherever the system's focus is currently active.

Default typing speed is fast. Hold ⌥ to have Alfred type at medium speed, or ⌥⇧ for slow speed.
